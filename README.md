# Phone-Area-Lookup-Flask
Area code lookup web app built with Flask. Enter a phone number to get the corresponding area name. Includes validation for Israeli phone numbers.

    Install Python 3.x on your computer if you haven't already.
    Clone the repository containing the Flask app from GitHub onto your local machine.
    Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
    Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Set the FLASK_APP environment variable by running export FLASK_APP=app.py on Linux/Mac or set FLASK_APP=app.py on Windows.
    Optionally, set the FLASK_ENV environment variable to "development" by running export FLASK_ENV=development on Linux/Mac or set FLASK_ENV=development on Windows to enable debugging features.
    Run the Flask app by executing flask run on the command line.
    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the running app.

Note: You can replace app.py with the name of your Flask app file, if it is different. Also, if you are deploying the app on a server, you will need to configure the server to run the app and expose it to the internet.
